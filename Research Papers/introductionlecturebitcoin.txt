Introduction to Bitcoin

- First reaction is "nerd money" probably just for Gambling. 

- As you read and learn more, you will end up finding new layers of depths to gain more insight.

- The reason it is so fascinating because it is not what it appears to be at first look. 

- Bitcoin is not just a money. The block chain is not just a system of currency. 

- It is a platform of trust. It is not a company or service we sign up for. 

- Bitcoin currency is just one of the many application. Decentralization is applied to the human communcation of values. 

- what is money ? - Money is the oldest technology the humanity has. For example: Spreadsheets. 

- Money - in the history of money, there have been about 5 major changes..shells, feather, stones,metals, papermoney, plastic money and now network money. 

- Bitcoin introduces a platform on which you can run currency as an application without any center point of control. 

- what is money - money is a linguistic abstraction. money is a language that we use to communcate the value to each other. 

money allows us to express value. And the value may have economic consequences. we use money to express and create social bonds and relationship and association. 

- bitcoin is first system of money that is decentralised. 

- we are moving from instittion based money to distributed network money. 

- bitcoin system also does not recognise the people. 

- we can remember the first time when we have presented gold certificate instead of real gold coin. 

- we can recall 1950 when someone showed us a token or card for dining or lunch. and said i will pay with this piece of paper.

- we are moving to network where the money can be moved anywhere is the world. 

- The blockchain technology unifies the systems of money. 

- In traditional banking system, we have different systems of money for small payments,large payments,different companies,for payments between government. 

====================================================Introduction to Bitcoin ==========================================

- Now does this remind us something ? Yes, that used to be the communication before the internet. we had systems of communication for pictures, systems of communication for letters and 

systems of communication for long distance and short distance and internet came into picture and unifies the all systems of communications. 

- Now the internet of money came and can do micro-transaction and giga transactions using same distributed computer networking systems in few seconds anywhere in the world. 

- but we just looking at the application of money then we are missing the point. 

=====we can use the same concept to create other modes of communications that create the value =====
  
- examples: Digital Tokens, reward points, brand loyalty coins etc

- Today there are hundereds of currency that use the same receipe or design pattern of bitcoin i.e block chain technology and network protocol. 

- over the next decades we will see hundreds of coins like bitcoins. some of them will be used for economic purposes and some will be used as an expression of loyalty.

- some of the coins will represent the existing items in the physical world. example: Title for house

- Example: The controlling key for car that can be transferred from one owner to another and after 5 seconds the new owner can step in to the car 
           because the car can validate the new standard of ownership. 

- We can not imagine how many applications can be built around this. 

- Banking has never been innovative in the world. 

Who manipulates the prices ? 
- The buying power is determined through market forces of supply and demand, the same way other currencies give us the buying power. 
One of the fundamental difference is that the bitcoin trading never stops. The whole bitcoin network up and running round the clock.
- There is no closing price of bitcoin. 

Reason for big hacks in bitcoin system ?
- currency is not centralised and you have a key and own it. 
- bitcoins exchange get hacked, bitcoin wallets get hacked but bitcoin itself can not be hacked.
- we still have centralised systems where people take the money and run away. 

- Bitcoin can be used as historical record of truths that are immutable.
