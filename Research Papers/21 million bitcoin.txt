Here's a mathematical explanation:

Calculate the number of blocks per 4 year cycle:

6 blocks per hour
* 24 hours per day
* 365 days per year
* 4 years per cycle
= 210,240
~= 210,000
Sum all the block reward sizes:

50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 3.125 + ... = 100(Geometric Series)

Multiply the two:

210,000 * 100 = 21 million.

========================================================================================================================================

Well when bitcoin was introduced for every block created one was awarded 50 bitcoins and that occurred every 10 minutes.

Because there are 1440 minutes (24x60) in every day, that means that 144 blocks were created so 144X50 = 7200 bitcoins per day

4 years are 1461 days (including the leap one) so the total bitcoins for the 1st 4 years is 1461 X 7200 = 10519200

Now .. since every 4 years we have to double-down the amount of bitcoins prize for every block found, the total bitcoins are 10519200 *(1 + 1/2 + 1/4+1/8 + … +1/2^n) = 10519200 *2 = 21038400 (its well know that 1+0.5+0.25+0.125+.. = 2 )

That number 21038400 is the theoretical limit since we cannot go forever mining a millionth trillionth of a satoshi. Actually (as for now) we cannot go less that 1 satoshi anyway. So the real number is just a little bit smaller than that, maybe 21038399.99999999 or 1 satoshi away from the theoretical calculation.

Now since every 4 years we have a double-down that means than in 40 years (in 2049) we will have 1/(2^10) = 1/1024 production of bitcoins, which means that since we started with 50 botcoins award after 40 yeras the prize of finding a new block will be aproximately 1/1000 of 50 bitcoin = 0.05 bitcoin per block (0.048828125 is the accurate result)

After 80 years (in 2089) the new bitcoins released for each block wil be 0.00005 bcoins/block (accurate result is 0.00004768 )

and after 120 years (in 2129) 0.00000005 or 5 satoshi per block (accurate result is 0.00000004656612873 or 0.00000004 or 4 satoshi). I dont know if its going to be 4 or 5 satoshi at that point … but i believe that 4 is the most precise although 5 is more close to the theoretical result)

The next 4 years (in 2133) it will fall to 2 satoshi and the next 4 (in 2037) to 1 shatoshi and in 2141 its less than a satoshi so it cannot continue after that to double down and the process stops since its less than the smallest defined unit which is a satoshi. So the last year of rewards will be 2140AD and for each block released you get a reward of 1 satoshi !!!

So satoshi should be very expensive in 2140 AD but its unlikely that we will be around to sell or use our shatoshis !

Economics 
=============================================================================================================================
In a centralized economy, currency is issued by a central bank at a rate that is supposed to match the growth of the amount of goods that are exchanged so that these goods can be traded with stable prices. 
In a fully decentralized monetary system, there is no central authority that regulates the monetary base. 
Instead, currency is created by the nodes of a peer-to-peer network. 
The Bitcoin generation algorithm defines, in advance, how currency will be created and at what rate. Any currency that is generated by a malicious user that does not follow the rules will be rejected by the network and thus is worthless.
The exact number of Bitcoins is not important. Whether the end result is 1 million or 100 billion makes little real difference.
The important aspect here is the process, not the quantity.
New Bitcoins enter the system in an orderly, predicable way.Outside forces cannot arbitrarily flood the currency with new money.
An incentive is provided for people to apply their CPU power to make the currency more secure.
Eventually, Bitcoin has to be self-supporting through transaction fees. Hence the tapering off of blockchain rewards.
Having said all that, there are some psychological advantages to having a low limit like 21 million. 
It was inevitable that people would see Bitcoin as being "more valuable" if the exchange rate for a whole Bitcoin was over $1. 
Ensuring this "high exchange rate" but making the coins highly divisible was probably a conscious design decision.
